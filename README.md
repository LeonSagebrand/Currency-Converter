# Currency Converter in React
This is a project I made where I implemented the same kind of API that I have used for a currency converter that was made in Python. 
The goal here was to make it user-friendly, keep it more dynamic, and lay the foundation to provide a more informative and realistic web application. 

## Features
- Real-time currency exchange rate conversion. (Updated every hour)
- User-friendly interface with dynamic input fields
- Supports conversion between multiple currencies
